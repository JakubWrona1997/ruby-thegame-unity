## General info
2D game created for a school project in Unity environment. 
Ruby is an enchanter with some kind of amnesia that finds himself in a mysterious village. He doesn't remember anything except the fact he's a magician. All he knows that he needs to find out what happened and why he's here.

## Work
So far we've implemented basic behaviour of our character. It means that he can walk across the map, can be hurt, can collide with environment, move to another location/scene and use his abilities. Now we're focusing on the AI system and other locations. 

Work is still in progress...
